School has been stressing me tf out lately, but as long I'm getting good grades I'm happy. Having a bunch of work and coding is not easy but hey I shold enjoy my chlidhood as long as I can because when I become an adult it will be much worse. Besides that today in coding class we're getting started on making a flag with coding. I'm doing the Japan flag because Japan is my favorite country! I want to live there a soon as I can, I've been learning Japaness as well! Wish me luck of going there and my coding prject! See ya!
