Hey guys! For these past few weeks we've been working on making flags from different crounties. As I mentioned last time I chose my favorite country Japan along with many reason why I love it. We had to search up our flag and recreate it paper in differernt colors, sadly I didi not finish. Later on we learned how to code the outline shape of our  flags on 'www.pyret.org'. We made accounts and as we coded we found out the the website provides us with information about how to make that shape and whta color we can make it. It was great!
